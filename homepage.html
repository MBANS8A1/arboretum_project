             <h2>Arboretum Synopsis</h2>
             <p>Welcome to the site of our picturesque arboretum located near Higham Hill, Walthomstow in London. We have an abundant collection of growing common and rare
              tree species as well as tree specimens that are relics of the ancient times. Feel free to inquire via about visiting the arboretum whether by yourself or with 
              family or friends so your journey well planned in advance.</p>

              <section id="history">
                <h3>How we became to be?</h3>
                <p>Sprouty's Flourishing Arboretum was established formally in 2018 under the "Parks For London" scheme rolled out by the Mayor's Office after receiving grants and charitable donations totally in excess of Â£650000000. The aim
                  of the arboretum was to create green spaces around London to reduce the amount of CO2 in our urban living spaces. Trees absorb approximately 25kg of CO2 per year so there so planting them is a strong counterbalance to climate change. 
                  We started with 14 species of trees but we aim to enlarge that by at least a quarter by the end of 2024.
