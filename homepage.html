             <h2>Arboretum Synopsis</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the site of our picturesque arboretum located near Higham Hill, Walthomstow in London. We have an abundant collection of growing common and rare
              tree species as well as tree specimens that are relics of the ancient times. Feel free to inquire via about visiting the arboretum whether by yourself or with 
              family or friends so your journey well planned in advance.</p>

              <section id="history">
                <h3>How we became to be?</h3>
                <p>Sprouty's Flourishing Arboretum was established formally in 2018 under the "Parks For London" scheme rolled out by the Mayor's Office after receiving grants and charitable donations totally in excess of Â£650000000. The aim
                  of the arboretum was to create green spaces around London to reduce the amount of CO2 in our urban living spaces. Trees absorb approximately 25kg of CO2 per year so there so planting them is a strong counterbalance to climate change. 
                  We started with 14 species of trees but we aim to enlarge that by at least a quarter by the end of 2024.</p>

                 <h3>A new magnolia species has been discovered in Central America</h3>
                 <p>We are happy to share with you that a new species of magnolia tree was found in Pico Bonito National Park, Hondoras at the end of 2023. The tree was found clinging to a steep
                  mountainside within the park and has been given the name <em>Magnolia ciroorum</em>.There are only five known specimens of the tree known in the world. We are currently
                  scheduled to have a meeting with Sergio Estrada and Donovan Aguirre of <abbr title="Pico Bonito National Park Foundation">FUPNAPIB</abbr> &#40 members of the park's foundation &#41 in September 2024
                  in order to discuss sharing of possible tree cuttings for study.</p>

                  <h3>Have you heard of trees that grow underground?</h3>
                  <p>Two new tree species have been discovered in the Kalahari sands of Angola. They are odd for treees because the only portions of them that are visible
                    are the flowers on the surface of the sand/soil. Their roots are adapted for nutrient-poor soils and sands. We are in contact with Kew Gardens&#39 David Goyder
                    about these species grow in free-draining sandy highlands about how we can contribute to the to the study of these underground trees with our dendrologists.

                  <h4><em>Cochlospermum adjanyae</em> &#40Adjany&#39s Cochlospermum&#41</h4>
                  <p>Belongs to a genus of around 16 different species of trees and have bright yellow flowers and palmitisect leaves. There currently is not enough
                    data yet to determine this tree&#39s conservation status.</p>

                  <p>The visible portion of this tree are white flowers wth a small triangle of yellow towards their base. This tree is in
                    this &#34Least Concern&#34 category as the grasslands it grows in and around are not under threat due to agricultural development.
                    Although considered a tree, it is part of the bean family.</p>
